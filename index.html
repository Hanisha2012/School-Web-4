            <h4>New school canteen</h4>
            <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-resposive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">

              The food optionsand responsibilities to consider,canteens must be better
              organised and more effecient than they have in the past. Online menu with 
              photograps of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their 
              ingeridients help both students and parents make the right nutritional 
              chocies. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
              provided with a school canteen account on the school website which keeps 
              a track of the previous meal chocies and any dietary requirments they may 
              have. Odering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate
              all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff 
              and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

            <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
            <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-resposive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7" >Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs the parents about their child's/ children's activities in the school, instantly.
              Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the satus via text messages. This helps 
 the school keep a reccord of the student's absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and 
 this is  stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential 
 that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and are not ready to establish connectivity
 with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or
 Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are
 posible since the tracker is supported with cloud capibilities. The securtity can be so robust and power
 that those students who fool their deans are caught in shorter span - just after the Admin the enters 
 the login details into this tracker.All this will improve accuracy and transperency in any of
 the educational institutions as students and their parents who are pre-informed about the real-time 
 status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
